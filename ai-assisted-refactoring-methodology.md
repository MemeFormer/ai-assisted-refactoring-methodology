# AI-Assisted Modular Refactoring Methodology

## Overview
This methodology leverages multiple AI assistants to refactor and integrate complex, multi-modal software applications. It addresses common challenges such as context limitations in large language models (LLMs) and the complexity of unifying standalone programs.

## Key Components

### 1. Mode-Specific Bots
- Create separate AI bots for each main functionality (mode) of the application
- Each bot has access to its specific codebase and functions
- Allows for focused, mode-specific improvements

### 2. Coordinator Bot
- A superior "coordinator" bot oversees the entire process
- Has access to all primary files
- Provides guidance to mode-specific bots
- Ensures consistency and alignment between different modes

### 3. Iterative Improvement Process
- Bots analyze their codebase and suggest improvements
- Developer implements changes based on recommendations
- Knowledge base for each bot is updated with the latest code

### 4. Cross-Functional Integration
- Bots are aware of shared modules
- Can suggest improvements that benefit all modes
- Helps unify the codebase and reduce redundancy

### 5. Context Limitation Workaround
- Splitting tasks among multiple bots
- Regular updates to bot knowledge bases
- Effectively works around context window limitations of LLMs

### 6. Continuous Documentation
- Automated scripts generate project overviews, READMEs, and file contents
- Keeps documentation up-to-date throughout the refactoring process

### 7. Guided AI Collaboration
- Specific instructions for bots on communication and information requests
- Ensures a structured approach to the refactoring process

## Implementation Steps

1. Divide the application into its key functions/modes
2. Create a bot for each mode using a platform like poe.com
3. Set up a coordinator bot with access to all primary files
4. Provide each bot with relevant codebase and overview information
5. Instruct bots to analyze their code and suggest improvements
6. Implement changes based on bot recommendations
7. Update bot knowledge bases with new code and outputs
8. Repeat the process, focusing on inter-mode integration and optimization

## Benefits

- Breaks down complex tasks into manageable pieces
- Leverages AI capabilities while working around their limitations
- Maintains up-to-date documentation throughout the process
- Allows for focused improvements while considering overall system architecture
- Facilitates the transition from standalone programs to an integrated system

This methodology showcases an innovative use of AI as a collaborative tool in software development, going beyond simple code generation to assist in complex refactoring and integration tasks.
